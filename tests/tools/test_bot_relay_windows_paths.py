r"""Windows-path viability and venv CLI resolution for bot relay (#93590).

Two failures on a Windows desktop install talking to a remote gateway:

1. ``waiter_command`` used to embed the reply path into generated ``python -c``
   source, where the Windows execution layer's backslash folding turned
   ``C:\\Users`` into a unicode escape and SyntaxErrored the script. The waiter
   is now a runner entrypoint (``bot_mode_dm.py --wait-reply``) that takes the
   path as argv, rewritten to forward slashes the way the delivery runner's
   argv is — the tracked local backend runs commands through Git Bash there.

2. ``local_delivery_command`` hardcoded ``"moor"``, relying on PATH —
   which service contexts (systemd units, desktop launchers, non-login
   SSH shells) do not provide, so delivery died with ENOENT. It now
   resolves the CLI next to this gateway's own interpreter (the venv
   bin/Scripts sibling), falling back to the bare name. The #93091
   turn-lock recognition in bot_mode_dm matches the CLI element by
   basename so resolved absolute paths (and ``moor.exe``) still take
   the per-profile lock.
