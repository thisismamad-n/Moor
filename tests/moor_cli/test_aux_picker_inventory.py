"""Auxiliary-task pickers share one provider-inventory substrate.

Every aux picker (``moor model`` → Configure auxiliary models, the
``moor tools`` vision picker, and any future one) must route through
``moor_cli.inventory.build_aux_picker_rows()`` so it shows the same
provider universe as ``/model``.

Two independent contributor PRs fixed the same two call sites for exactly
this reason:

- #52642 (@deepjia) — user ``providers:`` / ``custom_providers:`` entries
  were invisible because the aux picker never forwarded them.
- #66624 (@Drexuxux) — providers with a fully rate-limited credential pool
  were hidden because the aux picker never forwarded ``for_picker``.

Both were per-call-site kwarg patches, so the next aux picker would have
reintroduced the gap. These tests pin the *shared substrate* behaviour and
guard the seam itself, not the kwargs at any one site.
