"""A moor-authored systemd ``--replace`` drop-in must not survive unit refresh.

An older Moor wrote ``<unit>.d/20-replace.conf`` to end a respawn storm; it overrides ExecStart
with ``gateway run --replace``. Combined with the cross-profile ownership guard, that override turns
a per-profile fleet's unit into one that can never start (#119467). Refresh retires the Moor file,
and only that file: a drop-in the operator wrote is theirs.
