"""Plain-language copy for surfaces that cannot start because an optional dependency group is missing.

``moor dashboard`` (fastapi + uvicorn) and ``moor acp`` (agent-client-protocol) are installed by
the ``[all]`` / ``[acp]`` extras. A partial install, a pip-less uv venv or an interrupted update can
leave them out; the built-in repair is ``moor update``, which reinstalls the extras into the same
interpreter. The manual fallback names the checkout directory and interpreter explicitly because a bare
``pip install -e '.[acp]'`` fails on PEP 668 systems and in venvs without pip.
